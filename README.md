# Fauve for Floorp

![The Sideberg logo put inside the Floorp logo and the text "Sidebery; Fauve for Floorp](images/logo.png "Sidebery - Fauve for Floorp")

A simple [Sidebery](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery) CSS file for use with (a specific configuration using) Floorp or a modification of Firefox.

Xan uses the [Catppuccin Mocha Mauve](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/catppuccin-mocha-mauve-git/) theme with it.

My goal with these settings was to create a minimalistic yet functional setup
with Sidebery tuned to match Firefox Default Dark Theme and optimise the
workspace. If you find any odd behaviour feel free to send a pull request.

3. Open Sidebery settings and locate _Styles editor_ in the navigation. Paste the contents of [sidebery.css](sidebery.css) into the panel that says "Write custom CSS here..."
4. Find a theme, like Catppuccin, Dracula, Gruvbox, Noir, Nord, Tokyo Night, or .
5. Enjoy your new setup!

Set these settings under appearance in Sidebery (optional but recommended):

## Known issues

- Due to the width of the tabs, if marks to indicate indentation is enabled, multiple lines may show. This can be fixed by increasing the width of tabs.
